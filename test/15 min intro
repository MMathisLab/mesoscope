start by talking about the concept of modularity, pipelines are fine, we need them, but don’t start with a pipeline, start with modules, then build pipelines 

what’s the difference?

a module is small, reusable, narrow in scope, easy to understand! 

a pipeline is monolithic, tries to do everything at once

some modules be useful to many people, some are only useful to a small group, but if it’s useful by more than 1 person, you should put the time in to make it nice.

we’re trying to build modules for image and time series processing, try to make general modules, but some are really specific

going to start by showing you a module specifically for processing mesoscope data

MESOSCOPE TUTORIAL

----------------

design goals of thunder, collection of modules for image and time series analysis, use the ones you want

they do abide by a few common design patterns, in particular, images and series objects

core components are thunder, registration, extraction, factorization, and regression

THUNDER TUTORIAL

----------------

neuron identication is a huge problem, lots of approaches, but in my view we've suffered from a lack of ground truth and validation against ground truth

so we've been trying to tackle that, in collaboration with lots of other labs

neurofinder is one thing

and soon they'll be spikefinder
